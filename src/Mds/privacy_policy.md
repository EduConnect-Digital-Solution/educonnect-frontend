# Privacy Policy for EduConnect

**Last Updated: January 14, 2026**

## 1. Introduction

EduConnect ("we," "us," "our") is committed to protecting the privacy of the personal information we collect and process in connection with our School Information System (the "Service"). This Privacy Policy describes how we handle personal information, our role as a data processor, and the rights of individuals whose data we handle.

This policy is intended for our client Schools, as well as the Administrators, Teachers, Parents, and Students ("Users") whose information we process on behalf of a School.

## 2. Our Role: Data Processor

The School that subscribes to our Service is the **Data Controller**. This means the School determines the purposes and means of processing personal data. EduConnect is the **Data Processor**, processing data on behalf of and at the direction of the School.

## 3. Information We Collect

We only collect information that is necessary to provide the Service. This includes:

*   **Information Provided by the School:** The School provides us with most of the personal data we process. This includes:
    *   **Student Information:** Name, date of birth, address, parent/guardian contact details, grades, attendance records, disciplinary records, and other data required by the School.
    *   **Parent/Guardian Information:** Name, email address, phone number, and relationship to the student.
    *   **Teacher/Staff Information:** Name, email address, subjects taught, and role within the School.
*   **Information Collected Automatically:**
    *   **Usage Data:** We collect information about how Users interact with our Service, such as features accessed, time spent on pages, and other actions taken. This helps us improve the Service.
    *   **Log and Device Data:** When you use our Service, our servers automatically record information, including your IP address, browser type, operating system, and device identifiers.
*   **Information from Third Parties:**
    *   We may receive payment confirmation details from our third-party payment processors when a School subscribes to the Service.

## 4. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we process solely for the purpose of providing and improving the Service as directed by the School. Specifically, we use it to:

*   Provide, operate, and maintain the Service.
*   Manage User accounts and provide customer support.
*   Send service-related communications, such as maintenance notifications and security alerts.
*   Enforce our Terms of Service and other policies.
*   Generate aggregated and anonymized statistical data to improve service performance and features.
*   Comply with legal obligations.

**We will NEVER:**
*   Sell personal information to third parties.
*   Use personal information, especially student data, for targeted advertising.
*   Share personal information with third parties for marketing purposes.

## 5. How We Share and Disclose Information

We only share information in the following limited circumstances:

*   **Within the Service:** Information is shared among Users according to their roles as defined by the School (e.g., a Teacher can see their students' data; a Parent can only see their own child's data).
*   **With Third-Party Service Providers:** We use a limited number of third-party vendors to help us provide the Service (e.g., cloud hosting, email delivery). These vendors are contractually obligated to protect the data and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.
*   **As Required by Law:** We may disclose information if required by law, subpoena, or other legal process.
*   **Business Transfers:** If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, information may be transferred as part of that deal. We will notify the School of any such change in control.

## 6. Data Security

We implement a range of technical, administrative, and physical security measures designed to protect the information we process. These are detailed in our **Information Security Policy** and include encryption of data in transit and at rest, strict access controls, and regular security assessments. While we take security seriously, no system is impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee 100% security.

## 7. Data Retention

We retain personal data for as long as the School's account is active and as instructed by the School. Upon termination of an account, we will work with the School to either return or securely delete all personal data, typically within a 30-day period, unless required by law to retain it for longer.

## 8. School Verification Documents

*   **Purpose of Collection:** In accordance with our Terms of Service, we require educational institutions to submit official documents for verification purposes prior to being onboarded. This process is essential to confirm the legal status and legitimacy of the school and its representatives, thereby ensuring the safety and integrity of the EduConnect platform for all users.
*   **Document Handling and Security:** We are committed to handling this sensitive information with the highest standard of care. All submitted documents are transmitted securely and are used solely for the verification process.
*   **Data Minimization and Retention:** We follow a strict data minimization policy. We do not store these verification documents after the verification process is complete. Once the review is finalized and a decision is made, the documents are permanently and securely deleted from our systems.
*   **Compliance with Data Protection Laws:** Our handling of your data, including these verification documents, complies with the Nigerian Data Protection Act (NDPA) and other applicable data protection and privacy laws. We act as a Data Processor and adhere to the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency.

## 9. Your Data Rights

Since the School is the Data Controller, individuals (Parents, Students, Teachers) should direct any requests to exercise their data rights to their School's Administrator. These rights may include the right to access, correct, update, or delete personal information. We will provide reasonable assistance to the School to respond to these requests.

## 10. Children's Privacy

We process the data of children (students) on behalf of Schools. We rely on the School to obtain any necessary parental consent as required by laws such as the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) in the US or other regional equivalents. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children without the School's authorization.

## 11. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify the School's administrator of any material changes via email or through the Service.
